# Advent of Code 2019

These are the solutions I created during Advent of Code. When I was stuck I asked for tips
online. Therefore, I want to thank the community for their help and input.

I started this challenge in Python, but I quickly switched over to rust. This is mainly
because I wanted to learn Rust, and Python was kinda slow.

Things I learned from Advent of Code

- Make your intcode machine a separate module, it might come back a lot of times.
- A basic library would be nice to create for next year, grid printing, coordinate structs and basic
algorithms.
