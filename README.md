# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions of Advent of Code. I started the challenges in Python,
but quickly realized that I should improve in Rust instead. Hence, I switched
over to Rust. This means that I have (maybe had at this point) a backlog
of things I needed to rewrite. The basic structure of the IntCode machine came
from Redditors that did this in C++ and Rust, I build forward on that. So,
kudos to them for giving me inspiration. All code is licensed under the
